# Uplift Desk

<img src="../../assets/uplift_desk/home-assistant.png?raw=true" width="50%">

A configuration for [Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) desks using the RJ12 port on the control box. This is the same port that the official [bluetooth adapter](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bluetooth-adapter-for-uplift-desk/) uses.

## Supported Features

Currently, this integration supports the following:

- Commands
  - Move up
  - Move down
  - Stop
  - Save preset 1-4
  - Recall preset 1-4
  - Sync current height reading from the desk
  - Set a maximum height limit
  - Set a minimum height limit
  - Clear an height limits
- Sensors
  - Current height reading

## RJ12 Pinout

<img src="../../assets/uplift_desk/desk-pinout.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 25%">

I found the Uplift Connect dongle pinout via the [FCC filing](https://fccid.io/2ANKDJCP35NBLT/Internal-Photos/Internal-Photos-3727739) (Thanks to [deadman96385](https://github.com/deadman96385) for sending that my way)

There are 6 PINs on the desk's RJ12 port. The first and sixth PIN are not used. All communication occurs over UART and the ESP chip can be powered off of the 5v and GND PINs.
The port's pinout from left to right is as follows:

1. ? (Not known but not necessary)
1. GND
1. Tx
1. 5v
1. Rx
1. ? (Not known but not necessary)

## Hardware Setup

<img src="../../assets/uplift_desk/esp-wiring.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 25%">

I use a NodeMCU spliced to a 4-inch RJ12. They can be powered off of 5v, so I directly power the ESP from the desk's 5v output.

My current hardware could use a little polish, but I mounted it under my desk and never have to see it so I don't mind for now.

## Software Setup

1. Copy the [common config](../common) into your local ESPHome configurations.
1. Copy `uplift_desk.yaml` and `packages/uplift_desk.yaml` into your local ESPHome configurations.
1. Copy the relevant lines from `secrets.yaml` and fill in random API and OTA passwords.
1. Open `uplift_desk.yaml` and tweak the substitution values accordingly. The comments will explain each option.
1. Device will show up in ESPHome and be ready to build!

## Planned Features

### Commands

I noticed a lot of the Uplift Desk UART commands correspond to the commands documented for a Jarvis desk in [phord/Jarvis](https://github.com/phord/Jarvis). I am still testing out some of these commands. Namely:

- Setting units (in, cm)
- Setting anti-collision sensitivity (high, medium, low)
- Reset
- Height calibration

I am testing a "go to height" action, but it isn't perfect since the desk runs at full speed until it is commanded to stop. This is different than when the desk is moving to a preset, since it will slow down as it approaches the preset value. I would like to be able to do this when calling the "go to height" action, but I have not come across any indication that the desk supports speed values over UART. If it's not possible, I may be able to hone in the action by stopping it early, but so far it seems to be pretty inconsistent.

### Responses

- Sending a sync command makes the desk send its current height along with the saved heights of all 4 presets. I have not been able to decipher the preset heights. The values seem to be more precise than inches, with the second value as a decimal, but so far I have been unable to correlate them to actual height values or find any helpful calibration output. See my observed values below. Feel free to post any thoughts in [#2](https://github.com/gabe565/esphome-configs/issues/2).
